# Introduction
Hi, I'm Duke. I'm a self-taught programmer currently specializing in luau scripting on Roblox. I discovered a passion for programming in 2017, and have been refining my skills ever since. My main interests are programming, game-design and the general game development process on Roblox. I love bringing ideas to life by means of functional and effective code, and Roblox is the platform that caught my eye first and has become my bread and butter over the years.

# Past Roblox Experiences
## Sword Simulator X
I am working as a 3rd scripter for the maintenance of the **[Sword Simulator X](https://www.roblox.com/games/9103460924/Last-week-of-event-Sword-Factory-X)** game at the moment.

## Metablox Productions
I have previously worked for Metablox productions on a project, which was, unfortunately, cancelled after some time due to internal issues. However, this is just to show that I am skilled enough to work for such an amazing group as **[Metablox](https://www.roblox.com/groups/8267330/Metablox-Productions)**!

## Ro-Empires
I have also worked on a game with much potential known as **[Ro-Empires](https://www.roblox.com/games/8254715417/ALPHA-RoEmpires)**, which I had to quit due to personal reasons and lack of adequate time (at that time) to actively work on the game.

# Creations
## Custom animation track
I created a way of playing animations without necessarily uploading them to Roblox in live games. Though it has several limitations and is not near perfect, I'm very proud of this as it took a considerable amount of time to successfully make this.
The animation above was played using this **[animation track 2](https://github.com/server-script/animation-track-2)**.

## UI to code plugin
As the title suggests, this plugin converts any type of UI to code, this is particularly helpful for web developers who are used to making interfaces with code rather than an editor.
This was posted **[here](https://github.com/server-script/UI-To-Code-Plugin)**.

## Character viewport
Wanted to replicate the breaking point character viewport. Mid, but yeah, still took a while to make it ðŸ˜”

## Terrain generation
Made sure to add biomes this time ;)

## Combat System
Below is a very long **[clip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nMnTRg9CkBh61XwiW6LLui070lqqpd8I/view?usp=share_link)** of me testing the combat system out with a friend of mine :P. It's one of my very first combat systems.

# Ongoing Creations
At the moment, I am working on a universal simulator creator called SimCreator, which is basically going to be an open source simulator creating tool aimed at being able to create any kind of simulator in 3 weeks or less. Since it's ongoing, I cannot reveal details not any code. However, this can be done and it can be demonstrated privately.

## Secondary systems I've made before
### 3rd person gun system
I made this for one of those raiding games that usually entails a lot of movements hence the gun system was requested to look exactly like this.

### Dynamic pet system
I've made this for a lot of games so it's almost always inside my PC chilling.
It's quite hard to get a good video demonstrating the dynamic nature of the system as you can see ðŸ˜¢

### A Prototype of a gamejam minigame I made recently.
This prototype is about a prop hunt in which you can possess props and move while inside them, while hunters are supposed to look for you. The framework for this prototype was designed and created by **[Orodex](https://www.roblox.com/users/1930588726/profile)**, who is an amazing programmer I deeply look up to.

#### To be updated later on, I lost most of my work ðŸ˜”
